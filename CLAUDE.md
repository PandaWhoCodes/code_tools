# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is a documentation and content repository for curating coding tools, updates, and news. It is NOT a software project with code to build or test.

## Content Organization

When adding new content about coding tools, consider organizing them in the following structure:

```
/tools/
  /languages/        # Tools organized by programming language
  /categories/       # Tools organized by purpose (IDE, linting, testing, etc.)
  /updates/          # Latest tool updates and releases
/guides/             # How-to guides for specific tools
/news/              # Industry news and announcements
```

## Common Tasks

### Adding New Tool Documentation
1. Create appropriate directory structure if not exists
2. Use consistent markdown formatting for tool entries
3. Include: tool name, purpose, latest version, key features, and links

### Updating Tool Information
1. Check existing documentation in relevant directory
2. Update version information and changelog
3. Maintain consistent formatting with existing entries

## Content Guidelines

- Each tool entry should include: name, description, latest version, official website, and key features
- Use markdown for all documentation
- Include practical examples where applicable
- Maintain alphabetical ordering within categories
- Add relevant tags/labels for easier discovery

## Repository Maintenance

Since this is a content repository:
- No build/test commands needed
- Focus on content quality and organization
- Keep information current and accurate
- Ensure all links are working
