## üéØ Key CI/CD Practices

### Continuous Integration
1. **Automated Builds** - Build on every commit
2. **Automated Testing** - Run tests automatically
3. **Fast Feedback** - Quick build and test cycles
4. **Isolated Environments** - Clean build environments
5. **Build Artifacts** - Store build outputs

### Continuous Deployment
1. **Automated Deployments** - Deploy without manual intervention
2. **Environment Parity** - Consistent staging and production
3. **Rollback Capability** - Quick revert on issues
4. **Monitoring** - Track deployment health
5. **Progressive Delivery** - Canary, blue-green deployments

### Pipeline as Code
